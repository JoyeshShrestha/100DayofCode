# Introduction

Today we'll dive deep into a dataset all about LEGO. From the dataset we can ask whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the LEGO company, their product offering, and which LEGO set ultimately rules them all:

<ul type="square">
<li>What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?</li>

<li>How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?</li>

<li>Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago or a theme they licensed liked Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?</li>

<li>When did the LEGO company really expand its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets did it released year-on-year?</li>

<li>Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO
sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?</li>
</ul>

**Data Source**

[Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) has compiled data on all the LEGO pieces in existence. I recommend you use download the .csv files provided in this lesson.

## **Understanding LEGO Themes vs. LEGO Sets**

Walk into a LEGO store and you will see their products organised by theme. Their themes include Star Wars, Batman, Harry Potter and many more.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aKcwkSx.png">

A lego **set** is a particular box of LEGO or product. Therefore, a single theme typically has many different sets.

The <code>sets.csv</code> data contains a list of sets over the years and the number of parts that each of these sets contained.

**Challenge**: Read the sets.csv data and take a look at the first and last couple of rows.
